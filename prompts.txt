Give me your feedback on my implementation.
If there is something wrong, don't give me the full solution â€” just highlight the mistake to give me an opportunity to edit my solution.

Give me a diagram of a BinarySearchTree with pointers to help me understand it through visual representation and complete the implementation of insert and lookup on my own.

add pointers to it to help me track the node references.
